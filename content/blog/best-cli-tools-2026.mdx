The command line remains the developer's most powerful interface. Whether you're managing files, orchestrating containers, or automating workflows, the right CLI tools can dramatically improve your productivity.

We've analyzed hundreds of CLI tools using ToolShelf's quality scoring — factoring in maintenance activity, community adoption, and documentation quality. Here are the standouts for 2026.

## Package Managers & Runtime Tools

Modern development demands fast, reliable package management. Tools like **pnpm** and **bun** have pushed the ecosystem forward with better performance and disk efficiency compared to traditional npm.

## Terminal Multiplexers & Shells

Your terminal environment matters. **Zellij** offers a modern take on terminal multiplexing with a friendlier learning curve than tmux, while **Starship** gives you a blazing-fast, customizable prompt that works across shells.

## File & System Utilities

The Rust ecosystem has produced excellent replacements for traditional Unix tools:

- **ripgrep (rg)** — faster than grep, respects .gitignore
- **fd** — a simpler, faster alternative to find
- **bat** — cat with syntax highlighting and git integration
- **eza** — a modern ls replacement with colors and git status

## API & HTTP Tools

For API development and testing, **httpie** and **curlie** provide more readable output than raw curl, while **grpcurl** handles gRPC services from the command line.

## What Makes a Great CLI Tool?

Based on our analysis across 970+ tools, the highest-quality CLI tools share common traits:

1. **Active maintenance** — regular releases and responsive issue handling
2. **Great documentation** — clear README, man pages, and examples
3. **Composability** — works well with pipes and other tools
4. **Sensible defaults** — productive out of the box without extensive configuration
