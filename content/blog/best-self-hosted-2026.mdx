Self-hosting is having a moment, and it is not just about privacy anymore. The tools have gotten genuinely good -- polished UIs, easy deployment, mobile apps that rival commercial products. The gap between "self-hosted alternative" and "the real thing" has nearly closed.

Here is what is worth running on your own hardware in 2026.

## Photo Management

### [Immich](/tools/immich)

The Google Photos replacement that actually works. Immich has facial recognition, object detection, location-based browsing, automatic mobile backups, shared albums, and a timeline view that feels native. The mobile app is fast and reliable. With 90k+ GitHub stars, it is one of the most popular self-hosted projects in existence, and it deserves every one of them.

If you self-host one thing, make it Immich. The peace of mind of knowing your family photos live on your hardware, backed up your way, is worth the hour of setup.

## Web Analytics

The analytics space is crowded with self-hosted options, and that is a good thing. Google Analytics is overkill for most sites, invasive by design, and increasingly blocked by browsers. These alternatives give you the metrics that matter without the baggage.

### [Umami](/tools/umami)

The most popular open-source analytics platform, and for good reason. Umami is clean, fast, privacy-focused, and gives you everything you actually need: pageviews, referrers, devices, countries, and custom events. No cookies, GDPR compliant by default, and the dashboard is genuinely pleasant to use. If you are choosing one analytics tool, start here.

### [Rybbit](/tools/rybbit)

The newcomer that is turning heads. Rybbit bills itself as "10x more intuitive" than Google Analytics, and the UI backs that up. It is newer and smaller than Umami, but the design philosophy is sharp -- it surfaces insights instead of drowning you in data. Worth watching if you find even Umami too feature-heavy.

### [Plausible Analytics](/tools/analytics)

Lightweight, cookie-free, and ships a tiny ~1KB tracking script. Plausible is the choice when you want minimal footprint and maximum privacy. The hosted version is a paid product, but the self-hosted edition is fully open source. Great for blogs and marketing sites where you just need the basics done right.

### [Matomo](/tools/matomo)

The heavyweight. Matomo is the most feature-complete self-hosted analytics platform -- it can do everything Google Analytics does, including e-commerce tracking, heatmaps, session recordings, and A/B testing. The trade-off is complexity. If you need enterprise-grade analytics with full control, Matomo is the answer. If you want simplicity, look at the others.

## Personal Cloud and Platform

### [Olares](/tools/olares)

An ambitious project: a full personal cloud operating system. Olares bundles file storage, app hosting, and data management into a self-hosted platform that aims to replace the entire suite of cloud services you depend on. Still maturing, but the vision of a unified self-hosted stack is compelling. Worth experimenting with if you want to consolidate multiple self-hosted services into one platform.

## Deployment Platforms

### [Coolify](/tools/coolify)

The self-hosted Heroku/Vercel/Netlify alternative. Coolify lets you deploy applications from Git repos with automatic SSL, databases, and monitoring. It lives in the DevOps category but is essential for self-hosters who want push-to-deploy workflows without relying on cloud platforms. If you are already running a VPS, Coolify turns it into a full deployment platform.

---

**Getting started:** The easiest path is a single VPS (Hetzner, DigitalOcean, or similar) running Docker. Start with [Immich](/tools/immich) for photos and [Umami](/tools/umami) for analytics. Add [Coolify](/tools/coolify) when you want to deploy your own apps. The self-hosted stack compounds -- each tool you add makes the next one easier.
