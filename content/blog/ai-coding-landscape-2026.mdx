AI coding tools have gone from novelty to infrastructure. ToolShelf tracks **204 tools** in this category — by far our largest — and the landscape is shifting fast. The terminal is the new IDE, autonomous agents are writing real pull requests, and open-source is closing the gap on commercial offerings.

## By the Numbers

- **204** total tools tracked
- **195** open-source
- **7** free or freemium
- **2** paid

The open-source dominance is staggering. Of 204 tracked tools, 95% are fully open. The paid holdouts — primarily Cursor and GitHub Copilot — still command significant market share, but the competitive pressure from open alternatives is relentless.

## Key Trends

### 1. Terminal-First Coding Agents

The biggest shift in 2026 is the move from IDE plugins to terminal-native agents. [Claude Code](/tools/claude-code) (score: 76, our highest-rated tool in the category) lives entirely in your terminal, reading your codebase, running commands, and committing changes with full Git integration. [Aider](/tools/aider) pioneered this pattern with its Git-aware pair programming approach and remains a favorite for developers who want AI assistance without leaving their workflow.

This is not just a UX preference. Terminal agents compose with existing tools — pipes, scripts, CI systems — in ways that IDE plugins cannot. They fit into how experienced developers already work instead of asking developers to change.

### 2. IDE Integration Is Table Stakes

While the terminal gains ground, IDE integration has become a minimum expectation rather than a differentiator. [Zed](/tools/zed) ships with AI features built into the editor from day one. Cursor layers AI on top of VS Code's familiar interface. GitHub Copilot is everywhere. The question is no longer "does your editor have AI?" — it is "how deep does the integration go?"

### 3. Autonomous Agents Emerge

[OpenHands](/tools/openhands) (score: 69) represents a new category entirely: autonomous AI agents that can take a GitHub issue and produce a working pull request with minimal human guidance. These agents do not just suggest code — they plan, implement, test, and iterate. They are still best suited for well-scoped tasks (bug fixes, small features, dependency updates), but the ambition is clear.

### 4. Open-Source Catches Up

The gap between commercial and open-source AI coding tools is narrowing fast. Aider's multi-model support means you can use any LLM provider. OpenHands can run with open-weight models. The proprietary advantage increasingly comes down to polish and default model quality rather than fundamental capability differences.

### 5. Specialization by Domain

Generic "AI writes code" is giving way to tools specialized for specific contexts — MCP servers for framework-specific knowledge, fine-tuned models for particular languages, agents that understand your specific codebase deeply rather than treating every project the same.

## Top Picks

| Tool | What It Does | Score |
|------|-------------|-------|
| [Claude Code](/tools/claude-code) | Terminal-native agentic coding with full codebase awareness | 76 |
| [OpenHands](/tools/openhands) | Autonomous AI agents that ship pull requests | 69 |
| [Aider](/tools/aider) | AI pair programming with Git integration | 65 |
| [Zed](/tools/zed) | High-performance editor with native AI features | 61 |

## Getting Started

If you want to try AI coding tools for the first time, [Aider](/tools/aider) is the most approachable entry point — it works with multiple LLM providers, integrates cleanly with Git, and does not require you to change your editor. For a deeper experience, [Claude Code](/tools/claude-code) offers the most capable terminal agent available today. If you prefer a graphical editor, [Zed](/tools/zed) offers the best balance of performance and AI integration.
