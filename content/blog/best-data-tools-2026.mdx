Data tooling in 2026 covers a surprisingly wide range. You might need a full backend platform one day and a YAML parser the next. The common thread is getting data where it needs to go, in the shape it needs to be in, without losing your mind.

Here are the data tools that earned their place in our directory this year.

## Backend Platforms: Supabase vs Directus

[Supabase](/tools/supabase) and [Directus](/tools/directus) solve overlapping but distinct problems, and picking the right one matters.

**Supabase** gives you a full backend on top of PostgreSQL: auth, realtime subscriptions, edge functions, storage, and vector embeddings. If you're building a new app from scratch and want the fastest path from zero to production, Supabase is the answer. The developer experience is genuinely excellent -- the dashboard, the client libraries, the documentation. It's the rare tool where the hosted version and the self-hosted version are both good.

**Directus** is better when you already have a database and need to wrap it with an API and admin UI. It sits on top of any SQL database and generates a real-time GraphQL + REST API automatically. The data studio gives non-technical team members a way to manage content without touching SQL. Think of it as the headless CMS that developers actually like using.

**The short version:** New project, greenfield? Supabase. Existing database that needs an API layer? Directus.

## Desktop Database Clients

For the times you need to actually look at your data, two clients stand out.

[TablePlus](/tools/tableplus) is the premium option. Native app, fast, supports every database you'd actually use (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Redis, MongoDB, and more). The query editor with autocomplete, inline editing, and keyboard-driven workflow make it worth the license fee. If you spend real time in databases, this pays for itself quickly.

[Beekeeper Studio](/tools/beekeeper-studio) is the open-source alternative with a clean modern interface. It covers PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, and CockroachDB. The Community Edition handles most needs -- autocomplete, query history, table filtering, dark theme. It lacks some of TablePlus's polish, but the price is right and it's improving steadily.

## CLI Data Utilities

### yq: jq for Everything Else

[yq](/tools/yq) is one of those tools that feels invisible once you have it. It processes YAML, JSON, XML, CSV, and TOML using jq-like syntax. If you work with Kubernetes manifests, Docker Compose files, or CI configs -- basically any DevOps workflow -- yq turns painful manual edits into one-liners.

The syntax matches jq closely enough that your muscle memory transfers. Essential for anyone doing infrastructure work.

### Atuin: Shell History Done Right

[Atuin](/tools/atuin) replaces your shell history with a SQLite database and adds encrypted sync across machines. That command you ran three weeks ago on your work laptop? Atuin finds it. It filters by directory, hostname, and session, and the full-text search is fast enough that you stop bookmarking commands entirely.

The statistics feature is a nice bonus -- seeing your most-used commands and when you use them reveals workflow patterns you didn't know you had.

## Honorable Mention: PaddleOCR

[PaddleOCR](/tools/paddleocr) solves a specific problem brilliantly: extracting structured data from images and PDFs. Supporting 100+ languages, it's the bridge between unstructured documents and your data pipeline. If you're building anything that needs to ingest scanned documents, invoices, or receipts, PaddleOCR saves months of work compared to building OCR from scratch.

## Choosing the Right Data Stack

The best data tools in 2026 share a trait: they respect that data work happens at multiple levels. Sometimes you need a full platform, sometimes you need a desktop client, sometimes you need a CLI one-liner. The tools listed here cover that full range without overlap.

Pick Supabase or Directus for your backend, TablePlus or Beekeeper for browsing, and make sure yq and Atuin are in your terminal. That covers 90% of data workflows.
