The self-hosted movement has matured from a hobbyist pursuit into a practical alternative for teams and individuals who want to own their data. ToolShelf tracks **16 self-hosted tools** — a focused collection, but one with some of the most impressive open-source projects on GitHub.

## By the Numbers

- **16** total tools tracked
- **16** open-source
- **0** free or freemium
- **0** paid

Every tool in this category is fully open-source. That is the whole point: self-hosted means you run it, you own it, and nobody can change the terms on you.

## Key Trends

### 1. Immich Dominates Photo Management

[Immich](/tools/immich) has become the definitive self-hosted Google Photos replacement, and it is not particularly close. With AI-powered face recognition, automatic photo organization, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and a polished web interface, it delivers an experience that genuinely rivals the commercial product it replaces. The project's rapid development pace — multiple releases per month — has kept it ahead of every competitor in the space. If you self-host one thing in 2026, this is the consensus pick.

### 2. The Analytics Wars

Google Analytics' increasing complexity and privacy concerns have fueled an entire sub-category of self-hosted alternatives. The competition here is fierce:

- [Umami](/tools/umami) (score: 54) leads with a clean, minimal interface and focus on essential metrics. It is lightweight enough to run on the smallest VPS.
- [Rybbit](/tools/rybbit) is the newcomer positioning itself as "10x more intuitive" than Google Analytics — a bold claim, but the interface backs it up with real-time dashboards and a remarkably low learning curve.
- [Matomo](/tools/matomo) (score: 47) takes the enterprise approach with full feature parity to Google Analytics, including goals, funnels, and e-commerce tracking. It is the heaviest option but the most complete.
- [Analytics](/tools/analytics) (score: 48) from Plausible occupies the middle ground — more features than Umami, lighter than Matomo, with a strong privacy-first stance.

For most developers, Umami or Rybbit is the right starting point. Reach for Matomo when you need enterprise-grade reporting.

### 3. One-Click Deployment Gets Real

The biggest barrier to self-hosting has always been setup complexity. That is changing. [Olares](/tools/olares) and similar platforms aim to make deploying self-hosted software as simple as installing a mobile app. Docker Compose files have become standardized, reverse proxy configuration is increasingly automated, and projects ship with sensible defaults instead of requiring manual tuning.

### 4. Privacy as a Feature, Not a Compromise

Early self-hosted tools often felt like you were trading convenience for privacy. In 2026, that tradeoff is disappearing. Immich's AI features run locally. Umami's analytics are faster to load than Google's tracking script. The privacy-first option is increasingly the better product, not just the more principled one.

## Top Picks

| Tool | What It Does | Score |
|------|-------------|-------|
| [Immich](/tools/immich) | Self-hosted photo/video management with AI | 61 |
| [Umami](/tools/umami) | Privacy-focused web analytics | 54 |
| [Analytics](/tools/analytics) | Lightweight Google Analytics alternative | 48 |
| [Matomo](/tools/matomo) | Full-featured enterprise analytics | 47 |
| [Rybbit](/tools/rybbit) | Intuitive, real-time analytics | 42 |

## Getting Started

Start with [Umami](/tools/umami) for your website analytics — it deploys in minutes with Docker and immediately replaces Google Analytics with something faster and more private. When you are ready for a bigger project, [Immich](/tools/immich) is worth the setup time to reclaim your photo library from cloud providers.
