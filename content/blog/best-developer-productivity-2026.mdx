The Rust rewrite generation has won. The modern replacements for classic Unix tools are not just faster -- they have better defaults, better output, and they respect your `.gitignore`. If you are still using `grep`, `find`, `ls`, and `cd` in 2026, you are leaving speed on the table every single day.

Here is the modern developer toolkit.

## The Modern CLI: Rust Rewrites That Won

### [ripgrep](/tools/ripgrep)

The tool that started the Rust CLI revolution. ripgrep (`rg`) is a line-oriented search tool that is dramatically faster than grep, ag, and ack. But speed is only half the story -- it automatically respects `.gitignore`, uses smart case sensitivity, and has sane defaults that mean you almost never need flags. Once you alias `grep` to `rg`, you never go back.

### [fd](/tools/fd)

The `find` replacement you did not know you needed. Where `find` requires you to remember arcane flag syntax (`find . -name "*.ts" -type f`), fd just works: `fd ".ts$"`. Colorized output, `.gitignore` awareness, regex and glob support, and it is an order of magnitude faster. The syntax alone is worth the switch.

### [eza](/tools/eza)

A modern `ls` with Git integration, file type icons, tree view, and sensible color coding. The community fork of the unmaintained exa, eza is actively developed and has become the standard. `eza -la --git` gives you a directory listing that actually tells you something useful at a glance -- file permissions, sizes, Git status, and modification dates, all color-coded.

### [zoxide](/tools/zoxide)

The smartest `cd` replacement. zoxide remembers which directories you visit most frequently and lets you jump to them with `z foo` -- no more typing full paths. It learns your habits over time, so it gets better the more you use it. Integrates with fzf for interactive selection when there are multiple matches. The single biggest time-saver in this list, and the one people notice most immediately.

**The setup:** Install all four, add shell aliases (`alias grep=rg`, `alias find=fd`, `alias ls=eza`), and initialize zoxide in your shell config. Total time: ten minutes. Cumulative time saved: immeasurable.

## API Clients: The Post-Postman Era

Postman became bloated, expensive, and cloud-dependent. The developer community responded with a wave of alternatives that prioritize speed, offline use, and Git-friendly storage.

### [Hoppscotch](/tools/hoppscotch)

The lightweight, web-based API client that supports REST, GraphQL, WebSocket, SSE, Socket.IO, and MQTT. Hoppscotch is fast to open, fast to use, and requires no installation for basic use. The self-hosted version adds team collaboration. If you just need to fire off API requests without ceremony, Hoppscotch has the least friction.

### [Bruno](/tools/bruno)

The Git-native API client. Bruno stores collections as plain-text files in a folder on your filesystem using its own markup language (Bru). This means your API collections live alongside your code in version control. No cloud sync, no account, no vendor lock-in. If your team values reproducibility and Git workflows, Bruno is the right choice.

### [Insomnia](/tools/insomnia)

The design-first API client. Insomnia supports OpenAPI spec design, automated testing, environment variables, and Git sync. It sits between Hoppscotch's simplicity and Postman's feature set. The best option if you need to design APIs from specs and test them in the same tool.

**The pick:** [Bruno](/tools/bruno) for teams that live in Git. [Hoppscotch](/tools/hoppscotch) for quick personal use. [Insomnia](/tools/insomnia) if you do spec-driven API development.

## Analytics for Your Projects

### [Plausible](/tools/plausible)

Not a CLI tool, but essential for any developer shipping products. Plausible gives you clean, privacy-respecting web analytics with a ~1KB script. No cookies, no consent banners, GDPR compliant by design. The dashboard shows you what matters -- top pages, referrers, countries, devices -- without the data overload of Google Analytics. Every side project deserves this.

**Start here:** Install [ripgrep](/tools/ripgrep), [fd](/tools/fd), [eza](/tools/eza), and [zoxide](/tools/zoxide) today. Replace your muscle memory aliases. Then pick an API client based on your workflow. These are small changes with outsized impact on your daily development experience.
