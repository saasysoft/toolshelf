MCP won. What started as Anthropic's experiment in late 2024 has become the universal standard for connecting AI assistants to the outside world. Every major AI provider now supports the Model Context Protocol, and the ecosystem has exploded with servers covering everything from file access to Figma design handoffs.

Here are the MCP servers that actually matter in 2026, organized by what you need them for.

## File and Data Access

### [Filesystem MCP](/tools/filesystem-mcp)

The one you install first. Filesystem MCP gives your AI assistant read/write access to local files with configurable path restrictions. Without it, your assistant is blind to your project. The path-based access controls mean you can grant access to `~/projects` without exposing `~/.ssh`. Essential and non-negotiable.

### [Postgres MCP](/tools/postgres-mcp)

Read-only database access for AI assistants. The read-only default is the right call -- you want Claude helping you debug queries, not accidentally dropping tables. Invaluable for data exploration and schema understanding. If you work with PostgreSQL at all, this saves hours of copy-pasting query results.

## Code and Development

### [GitHub MCP](/tools/github-mcp)

The community-maintained GitHub server from the official MCP repository. Covers issues, PRs, repo search, and branch management. Solid for basic GitHub workflows from within your AI assistant.

### [GitHub MCP Server](/tools/github-mcp-server)

GitHub's own official MCP server, written in Go. This is the one GitHub actually maintains and ships. It tends to get new API features faster and has tighter integration with GitHub's auth model. If you have to pick one GitHub server, pick this one.

### [Playwright MCP](/tools/playwright-mcp)

Microsoft's entry into the MCP space. Uses Playwright for browser automation -- navigating pages, clicking elements, filling forms, taking screenshots. More reliable than Puppeteer MCP for complex web apps because Playwright handles modern frameworks better. The go-to for end-to-end testing workflows.

### [Puppeteer MCP](/tools/puppeteer-mcp)

The original browser automation MCP server. Still works well for simpler scraping and screenshot tasks. If you are already in the Puppeteer ecosystem, no reason to switch. But for new setups, [Playwright MCP](/tools/playwright-mcp) has the edge.

### [Figma Context MCP](/tools/figma-context-mcp)

A game-changer for frontend development. This server feeds Figma layout information directly to your AI coding agent, so it can generate components that actually match the design. If you use Cursor or Claude Code for UI work, this eliminates the "build it, screenshot it, iterate" loop.

## Web and Search

### [Brave Search MCP](/tools/brave-search-mcp)

Gives your AI assistant real-time web search. The free tier of Brave's API is generous enough for personal use. This is what makes Claude actually useful for current events, documentation lookups, and research tasks. Supports both web and local business searches.

## Reasoning and Memory

### [Memory MCP](/tools/memory-mcp)

Persistent knowledge graph stored as a local JSON file. Your AI assistant can create entities, relations, and observations that survive across sessions. Not a replacement for proper RAG, but surprisingly effective for personal knowledge management and giving your assistant continuity between conversations.

### [Sequential Thinking MCP](/tools/sequential-thinking-mcp)

A structured reasoning tool that helps AI assistants work through complex problems step by step. Supports branching, revision, and flexible depth. The difference is noticeable on multi-step problems -- it forces methodical thinking instead of jumping to conclusions.

## Productivity

### [Slack MCP](/tools/slack-mcp)

Read messages, send messages, search history, manage channels. The Slack integration that makes AI assistants useful for async communication. Particularly good for summarizing long threads and drafting responses with full context.

## Build Your Own

### [FastMCP](/tools/fastmcp)

If you need to build a custom MCP server, FastMCP is the Python framework that makes it painless. Clean decorators, minimal boilerplate, handles all the protocol details. You can go from idea to working server in under an hour. The community has rallied around this as the standard way to build Python MCP servers.

The MCP ecosystem is still growing fast, but these servers cover the core workflows. Start with [Filesystem MCP](/tools/filesystem-mcp), [GitHub MCP Server](/tools/github-mcp-server), and [Brave Search MCP](/tools/brave-search-mcp), then add servers as your workflow demands.
