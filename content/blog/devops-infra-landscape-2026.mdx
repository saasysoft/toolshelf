The DevOps landscape in 2026 tells a single story: self-hosted is eating the cloud. Developers who spent years paying Vercel, Heroku, and Datadog bills are discovering that open-source alternatives have caught up — and in some cases surpassed — the managed offerings. ToolShelf tracks **53 tools** in this category, making it one of our largest and most active.

## By the Numbers

- **53** total tools tracked
- **48** open-source
- **4** free or freemium
- **1** paid

Only one paid tool in a category of 53. The infrastructure layer has gone fully open-source in a way that would have been unthinkable five years ago.

## Key Trends

### 1. Self-Hosted PaaS Is Real

[Coolify](/tools/coolify) is the headline story. It gives you a Vercel-like deployment experience — push to Git, automatic builds, preview deployments — on your own hardware. Combined with automatic SSL, database provisioning, and a polished dashboard, it has become the default answer to "I want Heroku but I own the server." The project has grown rapidly, and its one-click app marketplace now covers most common deployment patterns.

### 2. Container Management Gets Visual

Docker is universal, but its CLI-only interface creates friction for teams managing dozens of containers. [Lazydocker](/tools/lazydocker) solved this with a terminal UI that shows logs, stats, and container state in a single glanceable view. For teams that want a web-based approach, [Portainer](/tools/portainer) provides a full management dashboard with RBAC, stack templates, and multi-environment support. Between these two tools, there is no reason to raw-dog `docker ps` anymore.

### 3. Monitoring Without the Invoice

[Uptime Kuma](/tools/uptime-kuma) replaced a generation of Pingdom and UptimeRobot subscriptions. A single Docker container gives you HTTP, TCP, DNS, and keyword monitoring with notifications via Slack, Discord, Telegram, and dozens more. The dashboard is clean, the setup is trivial, and the cost is zero. For deeper observability, [Grafana](/tools/grafana) continues to be the standard — its plugin ecosystem, alert management, and data source flexibility are unmatched in the open-source world.

### 4. Reverse Proxies Got Simple

[Caddy](/tools/caddy) has redefined what a web server should be. Automatic HTTPS out of the box — no certbot cron jobs, no renewal scripts, no configuration headaches. Its Caddyfile syntax is approachable enough for junior developers and powerful enough for complex routing. For teams running microservices that need dynamic service discovery and load balancing, Caddy handles that too with clean configuration.

### 5. Git Hosting Goes Lightweight

[Gitea](/tools/gitea) proves you do not need GitHub Enterprise to run a private Git server. It is lightweight, fast, ships as a single binary, and includes issues, pull requests, CI/CD via Gitea Actions, and package registries. For teams that need code hosting behind a firewall or want to avoid GitHub's pricing tiers, Gitea is the clear answer.

## Top Picks

| Tool | What It Does | Score |
|------|-------------|-------|
| [Coolify](/tools/coolify) | Self-hosted Heroku/Vercel alternative | 61 |
| [Gitea](/tools/gitea) | Lightweight self-hosted Git service | 61 |
| [Uptime Kuma](/tools/uptime-kuma) | Self-hosted uptime monitoring | 61 |
| [Caddy](/tools/caddy) | Web server with automatic HTTPS | 61 |
| [Grafana](/tools/grafana) | Open observability platform | 61 |
| [Lazydocker](/tools/lazydocker) | Terminal UI for Docker management | -- |
| [Portainer](/tools/portainer) | Web-based container management | -- |
| [MinIO](/tools/minio) | S3-compatible object storage | -- |

## Getting Started

If you are standing up infrastructure for the first time, start with [Coolify](/tools/coolify) on a cheap VPS — it handles deployments, databases, and SSL in one package. Add [Uptime Kuma](/tools/uptime-kuma) immediately so you know when things break, and [Lazydocker](/tools/lazydocker) to manage your containers without memorizing Docker CLI flags.

For production systems, layer in [Caddy](/tools/caddy) as your reverse proxy and [Grafana](/tools/grafana) for metrics and alerting. [MinIO](/tools/minio) replaces S3 when you want to keep object storage on your own infrastructure.
