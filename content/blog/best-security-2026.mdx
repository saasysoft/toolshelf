Security tooling for developers is a different category than enterprise security platforms. You are not looking for a SIEM or a SOC dashboard. You need tools that slot into your existing stack, protect your applications and infrastructure, and do not require a dedicated security team to operate.

Here is what is worth your attention in 2026.

## Reverse Proxy and Edge Security

### [Traefik](/tools/traefik)

The cloud-native reverse proxy that has become the default for container-based deployments. Traefik automatically discovers services from Docker, Kubernetes, and other orchestrators, configures routing, and handles HTTPS via Let's Encrypt -- all without manual configuration files. Its middleware system gives you authentication, rate limiting, IP whitelisting, and header manipulation out of the box.

What makes Traefik essential for security is the automatic TLS. Every service you deploy gets HTTPS with zero effort. Certificate renewal is handled automatically. In 2026 there is no excuse for running unencrypted services, and Traefik removes every barrier to doing it right.

For self-hosters running multiple services on a single machine, Traefik is the glue that ties everything together. Point your domain at Traefik, define labels on your Docker containers, and you have secure, routed access to every service with automatic certificates.

## Authentication and Identity

### [Authentik](/tools/authentik)

The self-hosted identity provider that replaces Auth0 and Okta. Authentik supports SAML, OAuth2, OIDC, LDAP, and SCIM with a visual flow designer for authentication workflows. It can proxy applications that have no built-in auth, add MFA to anything, and serve as the single sign-on layer for your entire self-hosted stack.

The flow designer is what sets Authentik apart. You visually build authentication workflows -- login, registration, password recovery, MFA enrollment -- with drag-and-drop stages. Need to add an approval step before new users can access an app? Add a stage. Need different auth flows for different applications? Create separate flows. It is genuinely flexible without being overwhelming.

If you run more than two self-hosted services, Authentik with [Traefik](/tools/traefik) as the reverse proxy gives you enterprise-grade SSO on your own infrastructure.

## Privacy and Physical Security

### [Secluso](/tools/secluso)

An unconventional pick, but an important one. Secluso (formerly Privastead) is a privacy-preserving home security camera system using end-to-end encryption. In a world where every commercial security camera sends your footage to someone else's cloud, Secluso keeps video data encrypted and under your control.

It matters for developers because it demonstrates a pattern: you can build privacy-first alternatives to cloud services without sacrificing functionality. The architecture -- end-to-end encryption with local processing -- is applicable far beyond security cameras.

## Vulnerability Detection

### [React2Shell Scanner](/tools/react2shell-scanner)

A specialized but critical tool. React2Shell Scanner detects the RSC/Next.js remote code execution vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-55182 and CVE-2025-66478) with high fidelity. If you deploy Next.js applications, run this scanner. These are the kinds of vulnerabilities that turn a deployment into an open door.

This is a good example of why staying current on security tooling matters. Framework-specific vulnerabilities need framework-specific detection, and generic scanners often miss them. React2Shell Scanner exists because the community needed a reliable way to check for these specific, high-impact flaws.

## Building a Security Stack

The practical security stack for most developers looks like this:

1. **[Traefik](/tools/traefik)** as your reverse proxy -- automatic TLS, rate limiting, and routing
2. **[Authentik](/tools/authentik)** for authentication -- SSO, MFA, and application proxying
3. **Vulnerability scanners** like [React2Shell Scanner](/tools/react2shell-scanner) for framework-specific checks
4. **Regular dependency audits** using your package manager's built-in tools (`npm audit`, `pip audit`)

You do not need a dozen security tools. You need the right ones configured properly. Start with Traefik for TLS everywhere, add Authentik when you have multiple services to protect, and run targeted scanners for your specific stack.
