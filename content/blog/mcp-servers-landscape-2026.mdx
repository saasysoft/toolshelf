What started as an experimental protocol from Anthropic has become the de facto standard for connecting AI assistants to the outside world. ToolShelf tracks **39 MCP servers** — and the number grows weekly. Here is what the landscape looks like heading into mid-2026.

## By the Numbers

- **39** total tools tracked
- **38** open-source
- **1** free or freemium
- **0** paid

The near-total dominance of open-source here is no accident. MCP was designed as an open protocol, and the community has run with it. The only freemium entry is [Brave Search MCP](/tools/brave-search-mcp), which wraps a commercial API behind the open protocol layer.

## The Protocol Wins

MCP has effectively ended the era of bespoke tool integrations. Instead of every AI assistant building its own GitHub connector, its own filesystem adapter, and its own database bridge, a single MCP server handles the integration and any compliant client can use it. Anthropic's official reference servers — [Filesystem MCP](/tools/filesystem-mcp), [GitHub MCP](/tools/github-mcp), [Postgres MCP](/tools/postgres-mcp), and [Memory MCP](/tools/memory-mcp) — established the pattern. The community scaled it.

The real story of 2026 is adoption beyond Claude. Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, and a growing list of editors now speak MCP natively, turning what began as a Claude-specific feature into a genuine industry standard.

## Key Trends

### 1. Official vs. Community Servers

Anthropic maintains a core set of reference servers, but the most exciting growth is happening outside that perimeter. [GitHub MCP Server](/tools/github-mcp-server) — built by GitHub themselves in Go — offers deeper integration than the reference implementation. [Playwright MCP](/tools/playwright-mcp), backed by Microsoft, brought first-class browser automation to the protocol. These vendor-built servers signal that MCP is taken seriously by the companies whose APIs it wraps.

### 2. The Framework Boom

Building an MCP server from scratch means handling JSON-RPC, capability negotiation, and tool schema validation. [FastMCP](/tools/fastmcp) changed that with a Pythonic abstraction that lets you ship a server in under 50 lines of code. With over 22k GitHub stars, it has become the default starting point for anyone building a custom server. TypeScript equivalents are emerging too, but FastMCP's lead is substantial.

### 3. Design-to-Code Pipelines

[Figma Context MCP](/tools/figma-context-mcp) opened a new category: servers that feed design context directly into coding agents. Instead of a developer manually translating a Figma mockup into components, the MCP server extracts layout information, spacing, and component hierarchy, then hands it to the AI. This design-to-code pipeline is still early, but it points toward a future where MCP servers sit between every tool in the development chain.

### 4. Enterprise Adoption Is Real

Companies are deploying MCP servers behind corporate firewalls to give AI assistants controlled access to internal databases, documentation wikis, and proprietary APIs. The protocol's built-in capability negotiation and permission model make it viable for environments where "just give the AI access to everything" is not an option.

## Top Picks

| Tool | What It Does | Score |
|------|-------------|-------|
| [Filesystem MCP](/tools/filesystem-mcp) | Secure local file read/write for AI assistants | 64 |
| [GitHub MCP](/tools/github-mcp) | Repos, issues, PRs through AI assistants | 62 |
| [Postgres MCP](/tools/postgres-mcp) | Read-only PostgreSQL access for AI | 62 |
| [Playwright MCP](/tools/playwright-mcp) | Browser automation via the protocol | — |
| [FastMCP](/tools/fastmcp) | Build MCP servers in Python, fast | — |
| [Figma Context MCP](/tools/figma-context-mcp) | Feed Figma layouts to coding agents | — |

## Getting Started

If you are new to MCP, start with the [Filesystem MCP](/tools/filesystem-mcp) server — it is the simplest to configure and immediately useful for letting an AI assistant read and edit project files. From there, add [GitHub MCP](/tools/github-mcp) to enable PR reviews and issue triage, and [Postgres MCP](/tools/postgres-mcp) if you work with databases daily.

For building your own server, [FastMCP](/tools/fastmcp) is the path of least resistance.
